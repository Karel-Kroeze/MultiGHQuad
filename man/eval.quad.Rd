\title{Evaluation of multivariate normal distributed integral}
\usage{
eval.quad(FUN = function(x) 1, X = NULL, W = NULL, debug = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{FUN}{LOG likelihood function of the parameters to be estimated.
Defaults to \code{funtion(x) 1}, in which case only the built-in multivariate normal pdf is evaluated.}

\item{X}{Matrix of quadrature points, see \code{\link{init.quad}}. Alternatively, the list of quadrature points and weights produced by \code{\link{init.quad}}.}

\item{W}{Vector of weights, or \code{NULL} if provided by \code{X}.}

\item{debug}{Logical, should we return evaluated FUN results?}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed on to FUN.}
}
\value{
A vector with the evaluated integrals, as well as a covariance matrix attribute.
}
\description{
Evaluates a given function with a (built-in) multivariate normal distribution with Gauss-Hermite quadrature.
}
\details{
The evaluated function is assumed to have a multivariate normal distribution, with a given mean vector and covariance matrix.
The default identity function \code{function(x) 1} reduces to an integral over a multivariate normal distribution with mean vector \code{mu} and covariance matrix \code{Sigma}.
}
\examples{
quadPoints <- init.quad(Q=3)
# expected value of 3-dimensional multivariate normal distribution: N(0,1).
# (Since mean is currently fixed at zero, this is always zero.)
integral <- eval.quad(X=quadPoints)
integral
round(integral)
}
